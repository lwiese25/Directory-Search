# Overview
This program was created to complete my CS II course. It reads in a file of tab-delimited Netflix titles, including the Director, Genre, RunTime, and several other aspects of the type of mediaâ€”TV Shows and Movies. The program then allows you to navigate the titles using a GUI with multiple tabs, allowing the user to search by director, title, run time, genre, etc. Another tab shows the statistics for each movie and TV show specifically. This project showcases object-oriented programming, GUIs, and I/O.


## Installation
To install this project, download all of the files from the repository. Then, run the program through the runner.java class. This will prompt the GUI to launch. You can load any test file from there to look at the program.
